            "(CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. \"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. \"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. \"Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,\" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. \"What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members.\" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it \"strongly\" disagreed with the court's decision. \"As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,\" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. \"We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,\" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as \"Palestine.\" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would \"conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality.\" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.\n",

            "(CNN)Never mind cats having nine lives. A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. \"Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,\" Mellado said, according to WSU News. \"She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life.\" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, \"She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home.\" She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to \"make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!\" Any additional funds raised will be \"paid forward\" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.\n",

            "(CNN)If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: . In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashanah,\" referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \"Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir.\" And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \"Iran never denied it,\" Zarif tweeted back. \"The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\" The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \"due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\" That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \"born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\" Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled \"Mr. Ambassador\" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.\n",

            "(CNN)Five Americans who were monitored for three weeks at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital after being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have been released, a Nebraska Medicine spokesman said in an email Wednesday. One of the five had a heart-related issue on Saturday and has been discharged but hasn't left the area, Taylor Wilson wrote. The others have already gone home. They were exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone in March, but none developed the deadly virus. They are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group. They all had contact with a colleague who was diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. As of Monday, that health care worker is in fair condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has said the last of 17 patients who were being monitored are expected to be released by Thursday. More than 10,000 people have died in a West African epidemic of Ebola that dates to December 2013, according to the World Health Organization. Almost all the deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.\n",

            "(CNN)A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday. The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting \"We are not afraid. We stand together,\"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. \"You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' \" Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a \"cowardly act.\" \"To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,\" Larry Moneta said Wednesday. Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.\n",

            "(CNN)He's a blue chip college basketball recruit. She's a high school freshman with Down syndrome. At first glance Trey Moses and Ellie Meredith couldn't be more different. But all that changed Thursday when Trey asked Ellie to be his prom date. Trey -- a star on Eastern High School's basketball team in Louisville, Kentucky, who's headed to play college ball next year at Ball State -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to Eastern's prom. So why is he taking Ellie instead? \"She's great... she listens and she's easy to talk to\" he said. Trey made the prom-posal (yes, that's what they are calling invites to prom these days) in the gym during Ellie's P.E. class. Trina Helson, a teacher at Eastern, alerted the school's newspaper staff to the prom-posal and posted photos of Trey and Ellie on Twitter that have gone viral. She wasn't surpristed by Trey's actions. \"That's the kind of person Trey is,\" she said. To help make sure she said yes, Trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read \"Let's Party Like it's 1989,\" a reference to the latest album by Taylor Swift, Ellie's favorite singer. Trey also got the OK from Ellie's parents the night before via text. They were thrilled. \"You just feel numb to those moments raising a special needs child,\"  said Darla Meredith, Ellie's mom. \"You first feel the need to protect and then to overprotect.\" Darla Meredith said Ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school, but a special program at Eastern called Best Buddies had made things easier for her. She said Best Buddies cultivates friendships between students with and without developmental disabilities and prevents students like Ellie from feeling isolated and left out of social functions. \"I guess around middle school is when kids started to care about what others thought,\" she said, but \"this school, this year has been a relief.\" Trey's future coach at Ball State, James Whitford, said he felt great about the prom-posal, noting that Trey, whom he's known for a long time, often works with other kids . Trey's mother, Shelly Moses, was also proud of her son. \"It's exciting to bring awareness to a good cause,\" she said. \"Trey has worked pretty hard, and he's a good son.\" Both Trey and Ellie have a lot of planning to do. Trey is looking to take up special education as a college major, in addition to playing basketball in the fall. As for Ellie, she can't stop thinking about prom. \"Ellie can't wait to go dress shopping\" her mother said. \"Because I've only told about a million people!\" Ellie interjected.\n",

            "(CNN)Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions, Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. \"The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year,\" said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's Secretary General in a release. \"It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people's lives -- putting people to death for 'terrorism' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence.\" The report, \"Death Sentences and Executions 2014,\" cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December. China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its \"Strike Hard\" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. Amnesty's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China, where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret. Belarus and Vietnam, too, do not release data on death penalty cases. \"The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide),\" Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty's Director of Global Issues, told CNN. \"A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition.\" While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria, \"against scores of people in some cases.\" The organization found \"positive developments\" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions. Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences . Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013. \"Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments,\" Gaughran said. \"Across the board, with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region.\" The resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year. The U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only Iran (289+), Iraq (61+), and Saudi Arabia (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available, Amnesty estimates that China also executes \"thousands\" of prisoners each year, \"more than the rest of the world put together.\" The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. \"In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards,\" the report stated. \"In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka.\" The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment. \"The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another,\" he said, in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October. \"We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights.\" Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.\n",

            "(CNN)Andrew Getty, one of the heirs to billions of oil money, appears to have died of natural causes, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman said. The coroner's preliminary assessment is there was no foul play involved in the death of Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, said Detective Meghan Aguilar. Andrew Getty, 47, had \"several health issues,\" Aguilar said, adding that an autopsy will be conducted. There is no criminal investigation underway, he said. Some medication had also been recovered from Getty's home, though investigators don't know whether Getty was taking it or what his medical history was, Ed Winter, assistant chief in the Los Angeles County coroner's office, told CNN affiliate KTLA Tuesday night. KTLA reported that Getty was found on his side near a bathroom in his home. Getty's parents, Ann and Gordon Getty, released a statement confirming their son's death and asking for privacy. Where the Getty family fortune came from . Gordon Getty is one of three living sons of J. Paul Getty, the oil baron who was thought to be the richest man in the world at the time of his death in 1976. Gordon Getty, 81, has a net worth of $2.1 billion, according to Forbes. One other son died in 1958 and another died in 1973. Gordon Getty spearheaded the controversial sale of Getty to Texaco for $10 billion in 1984. In its list of richest American families, Forbes estimated the Gettys' net worth to be about $5 billion. Court records show Andrew Getty had recently filed to get a restraining order against an ex-girlfriend. A hearing in the case had been scheduled for next week. In his request, Getty said he had been diagnosed with a serious medical condition in 2013. \"A rise in my blood pressure places me in grave risk of substantial and irreparable injury or death,\" he wrote in the petition. \"My doctors have advised that heated arguments can cause my blood pressure to rise dangerously.\" Andrew Getty had three brothers and three half-sisters.

            "(CNN)Filipinos are being warned to be on guard for flash floods and landslides as tropical storm Maysak approached the Asian island nation Saturday. Just a few days ago, Maysak gained super typhoon status thanks to its sustained 150 mph winds. It has since lost a lot of steam as it has spun west in the Pacific Ocean. It's now classified as a tropical storm, according to the Philippine national weather service, which calls it a different name, Chedeng. It boasts steady winds of more than 70 mph (115 kph) and gusts up to 90 mph as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Saturday. Still, that doesn't mean Maysak won't pack a wallop. Authorities took preemptive steps to keep people safe such as barring outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, diving and boating in some locales, as well as a number of precautionary evacuations. Gabriel Llave, a disaster official, told PNA that tourists who arrive Saturday in and around the coastal town of Aurora \"will not be accepted by the owners of hotels, resorts, inns and the like ... and will be advised to return to their respective places.\" Aldczar Aurelio, a meteorologist with the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), said the storm was centered 200 miles southwest of Aurora province as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) and heading west at a 12.5 mph clip. It's expected to make landfall Sunday morning on the southeastern coast of Isabela province and be out of the Philippines by Monday. Ahead of the storm. Isabela Gov. Faustino Dry III warned Saturday that residents should act as if this will be \"no ordinary typhoon.\" Dry told PNA, \"We do not know what the impact will be once it will make landfall.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "The Government Accountability Office released a report on Wednesday that concluded there are “wide-ranging” issues facing Army watercraft, which limit the Army’s ability “to meet mission requirements in the Indo-Pacific theater where the need for Army watercraft is most pronounced.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite Army policy requiring the vessels to be at least at a 90% mission capable rate — meaning the vessels are ready to perform their mission — the boats currently have a less than 40% capable rate this year. Overall, the fleet of watercraft has dropped by nearly half since 2018, going from 134 vessels to 70 as of May this year, in part due to divestment of vessels in 2018 and 2019.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Army officials stated that these low mission capable rates, along with the smaller size of the watercraft fleet after divestment, hinder operational readiness and the ability to meet mission requirement,” the report said. “Army officials also stated that with such low rates, usually fewer than half the vessels in the fleet are available at any given time.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The Army’s watercraft came under significant scrutiny this year during the troubled temporary pier mission meant to increase humanitarian aid flow to Palestinians in Gaza. CNN reported in June that the vessels responsible for the temporary pier — called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore, or JLOTS —  were not well resourced or maintained by the Army.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Army boats have not been ready, capable, or in a mindset they’ll have to do something dangerous or in the real world … for decades now,” a retired warrant officer and former chief engineer on Army watercraft told CNN at the time.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "After the temporary pier mission ended — the pier was only operational for roughly 20 days in total with a cost of $230 million — the military requested civilian contractor support in bringing the Army’s vessels back to the US. A defense official said at the time that it’s more cost effective and safer to have them transported back that way.\n",
        "\n",
        "One vessel is currently being transported back to the US while two others are expected to be loaded for transport this weekend, Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said on Friday. Another vessel is undergoing “routine maintenance” which is expected to be completed next week; that vessel is anticipated to be underway by the end of October, Smith said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Smith said that the Army is “actively” working to address gaps in the watercraft’s capability as a whole, and prioritizing improving the current fleet while also “investing in a modernized fleet to meet the needs of the 2040 force.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Col. Dave Butler, a spokesman for Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, told CNN that the Army is also looking at possibly replacing the existing fleet of Army watercraft with autonomous vessels in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What we see is the oil industry and other shipping industries are doing this already, we see that happening all around the world,” Butler said. “There’s no reason the Army shouldn’t be thinking that way … leaders from down at ship level all the way to the Pentagon are looking at this and determining the best way to deploy our forces.”\n",
        "\n",
        "US soldiers stand next to one of two US Army vessels that ran aground in Israel's coastal city of Ashdod on May 25, 2024. The US military said four of its vessels, supporting a temporary pier built to deliver aid to Gaza by sea, had run aground in heavy seas.\n",

        "The GAO report released this week says that “significant maintenance challenges” have contributed to the vessels’ low state of readiness, exacerbated by “aging vessels, supply shortages, and obsolete parts.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The report includes one example of a Landing Craft Utility vessel which has been under maintenance since 2018. While the vessel was originally scheduled to be repaired and operational by January 2021, it was delayed by at least three years. The Army “had to revise the contract seven times due to the expanded scope of work” after discovering more than 40% of the boat’s hull required “significant unplanned repairs.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“The expanded scope of work added further delays and costs, exceeding the initial maintenance estimate by over $1.2 million,” the GAO report said.\n",
        "\n",
        "In another example included in the report, the GAO says the Army identified in 2010 “safety concerns” with the ramp on an LCU, used for loading and unloading people or equipment.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Despite the risk of catastrophic failure and loss of life, the Army did not replace bow ramp components essential for safety,” the report says, adding that one ramp fell off a LCU vessel in 2022 “in open seas” near Japan. The Army did not appear to act until a briefing from the GAO in 2023, more than 10 years after concerns were first identified. An inspection of all LCUs that followed the GAO briefing that year found roughly one-third of the vessels “failed the inspection and were pending repairs.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The report includes a response from Army Secretary Christine Wormuth, who says the Army is “actively pursuing a holistic approach to mitigate the gaps in Army watercraft capability and capacity.” In regards to the mission needs in the Pacific specifically, Wormuth said Army Futures Command is working with US Army Pacific and Indo-Pacific Command to address concerns about the watercraft’s mission readiness.\n",
        "\n",
        "The GAO report also said the Army is considering leasing civilian watercraft to bolster its existing fleet and moving all of its watercraft to the Pacific. Butler also said the Army was actively talking to Congress about leasing civilian vessels, and even hosted representatives recently in Hawaii on the Army watercraft to discuss the benefits of leasing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Army established a governing board in February this year to help provide oversight of the watercraft, though the GAO found that as of May, the board hadn’t yet started talking steps on key responsibilities of its oversight role, like establishing how information would be distributed to stakeholders or how frequently the board would meet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, the Army watercraft is “how the ground force, the Army, gets to war,” Butler said.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Maybe the future fleet is all autonomous, we just don’t know,” he said. “This is all stuff we’re looking at in terms of trying to modernize the way we move people, weapons, and equipment.”\n",

        "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, with widespread impacts on the environment, human health, and the global economy. The scientific community overwhelmingly agrees that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have accelerated the natural process of climate change by releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.\n",
        "\n",
        "The effects of climate change are already evident in rising global temperatures, melting polar ice caps, and increasing sea levels. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires, are becoming more frequent and severe. These changes have devastating effects on ecosystems, biodiversity, and agriculture. The loss of biodiversity, in turn, threatens food security and increases the vulnerability of human populations to diseases and natural disasters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, climate change has significant economic implications. As temperatures rise and weather patterns become more unpredictable, industries such as agriculture, fishing, and tourism are facing new challenges. For instance, droughts and floods disrupt crop production, leading to food shortages and higher prices. Coastal communities are at risk due to rising sea levels, which could displace millions of people and cause billions of dollars in property damage. Additionally, health-related costs are expected to increase as heatwaves and pollution exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Efforts to combat climate change have gained momentum in recent years, with international agreements such as the Paris Agreement setting ambitious goals to limit global warming. Governments, corporations, and individuals are being urged to reduce their carbon footprints by adopting renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and implementing sustainable practices. However, transitioning to a low-carbon economy requires substantial investments in technology, infrastructure, and education. Developing countries, in particular, face additional challenges in balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability.\n",

        "Remote work has seen a significant rise in popularity, especially following the global pandemic that forced many companies to adopt new ways of operating. One of the most prominent benefits of remote work is flexibility. Employees have the ability to work from anywhere, eliminating the need for long commutes and allowing for a better work-life balance. This flexibility can lead to increased productivity, as workers can create a personalized environment that suits their preferences and minimizes distractions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For companies, remote work can result in reduced overhead costs. Without the need for large office spaces, companies can save on rent, utilities, and other office-related expenses. Additionally, it allows businesses to tap into a broader talent pool. By removing geographical barriers, companies can hire employees from different cities, states, or even countries, promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, remote work also comes with its own set of challenges. One of the main concerns is communication. Without face-to-face interactions, maintaining clear and effective communication among team members can be difficult. Virtual meetings and email communication may not always convey the full context of a discussion, leading to misunderstandings. Building team camaraderie and maintaining company culture are also challenging in a remote setup, as spontaneous interactions and social events are limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another issue is the potential for burnout. While remote work offers flexibility, it can also blur the boundaries between work and personal life. Many remote workers find themselves working longer hours or being unable to disconnect from work, leading to increased stress and burnout. Additionally, some employees may feel isolated or disconnected from their teams, impacting their mental well-being.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, remote work offers many benefits, including flexibility, cost savings, and access to a wider talent pool. However, it also presents challenges, particularly in communication, maintaining work-life balance, and fostering team connections. As companies continue to navigate the future of work, finding the right balance between remote and in-office work may be key to long-term success.\n",

        "Challenges in tackling PM2.5 Crisis\n",
        "Nipon Poapongsakorn, Kamphol Pantakua, and Suthipat Ratchakorn\n",
        "\n",
        "Chiang Mai has repeatedly been named the world’s most air-polluted city this year. Not exactly a title to be envious about.The city was hit hard by PM2.5 ultra-fine dust on March 31. IQair.com, an air quality reporting website, reported Chiang Mai had an air quality index of 320 with an ultra-fine PM2.5 dust level of 269.2 microgrammes per cubic metre (μg/m3), far beyond the World Health Organization (WHO)’s “safe” limit of 25 μg/m3.\n",
        "According to the World Bank, PM2.5 dust caused damages of 210 billion baht in 1990. This jumped to 870 billion baht in 2013. Meanwhile, a 2019 study by one economist  found the financial burden from PM2.5 on households in Bangkok and its satellite provinces amounted to 436 billion baht a year.\n",
        "The impact on human health is clearly the most serious concern. The State of Global Air report blamed toxic haze for 32,200 deaths in 2019. Greenpeace (Thailand) recently linked the ultra-fine dust to 29,000 premature deaths in 36 provinces — making it a much bigger threat than the death toll from traffic accidents, narcotics and homicides.\n",
        "Fumes from car exhausts, especially diesel engines, and traffic congestion are the major causes of air pollution in Bangkok and other big cities. As of January, there were 3.2 million diesel engine pick-up trucks in Bangkok, or 27.5% of the 11.6 million registered vehicles in the capital. Other causes of toxic dust are the fossil fuels used in power plants, as well as waste burning and household activities. On the other hand, air pollution in rural areas is associated with the open burning of major cash crops such as sugarcane and maize. Due to farm labor shortages and expensive machinery, burning is still seen as the cheapest method. The situation gets worse with the spread of wildfires, intensified by the dryness during this season.\n",
        "It is a deep-seated structural problem that prevents the government from resolving the haze issue. To begin with, the panel tasked to oversee the PM2.5 crisis operates as an ad hoc body without any consistency.  Most of the budget allocated to tackling haze is concentrated within departments in the central administration but not the local agencies. To give a clear picture, it could be said that of a four-baht request, the Budget Bureau would only hand over one baht to be shared among a group of agencies instead of cooperating and streamlining their tasks.\n",
        "This greatly affects how the money can cascade down into localities. What happens is the provincial budget keeps dropping — from 48.6 billion baht in 2018 to 19.6 billion baht in 2020 — compared to the cluster budget, which was halved from 16.3 billion baht in 2018 to 8.4 billion baht in 2020. The budget structure for both the provinces and clusters for 2024 is the same as that in 2020.\n",
        "The government must solve these problems at their core by tackling the inadequate state regulations, ineffective bureaucracy and isolated management. The government cannot stick with its same old centrality; different departments must be given authority to have “departmentocracy”. The government must look at haze as a chronic health and environmental threat, instead of “seasonal air pollution” that will be dissipated over time when the rain comes.\n",
        "To deal with it in a more effective and focused manner, Thailand needs better quality data on airshed areas. The government must fund research to learn more about the volume and movement of this kind of air pollution. Armed with this information, provinces that fall under the same airshed could work together, and ensure the appropriate budget allocation. Cooperation should also be fostered with neighbouring countries and Thai businesses that promote monocrops like maize or sugarcane in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar.\n",
        "For the agricultural sector, the government should provide subsidies to farmers keen to turn to agricultural machinery, so they can stop burning waste on their farms. Studies and increased development should be promoted for alternative plants that may create new income-generating jobs.\n",
        "In the long term, the government must strive to establish a mandatory carbon market so that local people will be incentivised to protect the forest and make money from carbon trading. The government must also have the courage to collect a carbon tax, based on the social cost from human activities, so that the national and local governments will have sufficient funds to mitigate the impact and provide remedies to affected parties and areas.\n",
        "For the transport sector, the government must be more ambitious in aiming for a higher and tougher environmental benchmark. It must launch a policy and plan to have all diesel engines phased out by imposing more diesel tax and replacing these with cleaner electric vehicles (EV) or hydrogen car engines. This means owners must be granted incentives and subsidies to make the transition to cleaner engines.\n",
